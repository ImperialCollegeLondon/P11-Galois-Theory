# P11-Galois-Theory
Lean notes for Imperial course P11 : Galois Theory

### Galois Theory, by Kevin Buzzard and Kenny Lau (or the other way around, I don't care).

Kenny proves the fundamental theorem of Galois theory in Lean, using mathlib, and I document what he's doing. We proceed whenever we have the time. Kevin remarks that after Christmas he will have quite a lot of time for this project, but there is no hurry.

[When we finish we just make some tidied up version of the repo public and then just give the book away for free. The target audience is intelligent Imperial first year undergraduates who know some Lean.]
